# MPE Render

`mpe-render` is a command-line tool that can be used to render markdown files to PDF.
While it uses pandoc under the hood, it aims to achieve full compatibility with extensions available in "Markdown Preview Enhanced", which is a extension for VS Code.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/Skn0tt/mpe-render
cd mpe-render
./mpe-render README.md
open README.pdf
```
